ABSTRACT: This paper reports sonochemical synthesis and characterization of Mn−ferrite nanoparticles using acetates
precursors. Mn−ferrite synthesis requires external calcination of oxide precursors formed by sonication. pH does not play a
dominant role in the synthesis. Collisions between metal oxide particles induced by shock waves generated by transient cavitation
are unable to cross the activation energy barrier for the formation of ferrite. The calcination temperature is a significant parameter
that influences the magnetic properties of ferrites. The size, coercivity, and saturation magnetization of ferrite particles increases
with the calcination temperature. Ferrites formed at calcination temperatures of 650, 750, and 850 °C show ferromagnetic
behavior with easy axis magnetization. Calcination at 950 °C leads to the formation of rods with grain growth that introduces
large shape anisotropy. The magnetization curve for rods does not reach saturation, indicating paramagnetic behavior. The cause
leading to this effect is nonalignment of the easy axis of magnetization with the direction of the applied magnetic field, resulting
in hard axis magnetization.
