Metal ferrites are among the most researched materials in
modern day materials science, because of their potential
applications in electronic gadgets, such as ignition systems,
generators, vending machines, medical implants, watches,
inductor core, transformer circuits, magnetic sensors, recording
equipment, telecommunications, magnetic fluids and magnetic
resonance imaging, microwave absorbers, and similar other
applications.1−3 A major virtue of metal ferrites is high electrical
resistivity, which prevents the induction of eddy currents and
the resultant loss of energy. This makes ferrites the most useful
materials for use in very-high-frequency fields. Ferrites also
exhibit high permeability and stability in terms of temperature
of operation and longevity. With reduction in particle size, the
structural and magnetic properties are further enhanced. Thus,

the development of new synthesis techniques for transition-
metal ferrite nanoparticles with less-expensive precursors and

less hazardous and energy-intensive chemistry has been an area
that has witnessed intense research activity. Spinel ferrites have
a general formula (MδFe1−δ)[M1−δFe1+δ]O4, where δ is the
cation distribution factor. This factor illustrates the fraction of
tetrahedral (A) sites occupied by divalent metal (M2+) cations.
The round and square brackets in the general formula denote
the tetrahedral (A) and octahedral (B) interstitial sites. M is the
divalent (Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+ etc.) and Fe is the
trivalent (Fe3+) metal cation occupying the face-centered cubic
(FCC) lattice formed by O2− anions. If δ = 1, the resulting
compound is called “normal” spinel, where all divalent (M)
cations occupy tetrahedral (A) sites and all trivalent (Fe3+)
cations occupy octahedral (B) sites. In this case, the compound
can be represented by the formula (M)[Fe3+Fe3+]O4. For δ = 0,
the compound is called “inverse” spinel, i.e., (Fe3+)[MFe3+]O4,
in which the divalent cations occupy the B sites and the
trivalent cations are equally divided among the A and leftover B
